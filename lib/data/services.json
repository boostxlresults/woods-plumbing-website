Is it grease buildup from kitchen use? Tree roots infiltrating your sewer line? Years of mineral scale narrowing your pipes? Each situation requires a different solution. Our hydro-jetting equipment delivers up to 4,000 PSI of water pressure, scouring pipe walls clean and restoring full flow capacity—something no chemical or cable machine can achieve.\n\nFor kitchen drains plagued by grease, bathroom drains clogged with hair and soap scum, or main sewer lines blocked by debris, our technicians have the right tool for every situation. We also identify potential problems before they become emergencies, like developing root intrusions or deteriorating pipe sections.

    "longDescription": "When your home's pipes reach the end of their lifespan, repairs become a game of whack-a-mole—fix one leak, another appears. Whole-house repiping replaces your entire water supply system with modern materials designed to last 50+ years, eliminating the cycle of recurring repairs and giving you peace of mind for decades.\n\nWood's Plumbing has repiped hundreds of Southern Arizona homes, from 1950s ranch houses with deteriorating galvanized steel to 1980s homes with failing polybutylene. We specialize in minimally-invasive repiping techniques that preserve your walls, ceilings, and landscaping. Using flexible PEX tubing, we can often route new supply lines through existing pathways, requiring far fewer wall openings than traditional rigid copper installations.\n\nOur repiping crews work systematically room by room, typically completing an average home in 2-3 days. We coordinate with drywall contractors and painters if needed, managing the entire project so you deal with one company from start to finish. The result is consistent water pressure throughout your home, elimination of rusty discolored water, and protection against the flooding that aging pipes inevitably cause. We'll help you understand the warning signs that indicate repiping is necessary and provide a detailed assessment of your current plumbing system.",

Wood's Plumbing installs and services water conditioning systems that transform harsh desert water into the soft, clean water your home deserves.\n\nHard water costs you money in ways you might not realize. Water heaters fail years early because calcium scale insulates heating elements, forcing them to work harder and eventually burn out. Dishwashers and washing machines clog with mineral deposits. Faucets and showerheads need constant replacement. Your skin and hair suffer from the drying effects of mineral-laden water. A properly sized water conditioning system eliminates all of these problems.\n\nWe offer multiple conditioning technologies to match your water quality, usage patterns, and preferences. Traditional salt-based softeners remain the most effective for extremely hard water. Salt-free conditioning systems prevent scale without adding sodium, ideal for those on low-sodium diets. Whole-house filtration removes chlorine taste and odor. We test your water, analyze your usage, and recommend the right system—then handle professional installation and teach you simple maintenance. With decades of experience with Tucson's unique water chemistry, we size systems correctly the first time.",

Wood's Plumbing provides emergency gas leak repair with the urgency these dangerous situations require. If you smell rotten eggs or sulfur, hear hissing near gas lines, or notice dead vegetation near buried gas lines, leave immediately and call us.\n\nOur gas leak specialists carry advanced electronic detection equipment that locates leaks with pinpoint accuracy, even in buried lines or behind walls. Unlike the soap bubble test that only works on accessible fittings, our combustible gas detectors sense minute concentrations in the air, leading us directly to the source. Once located, we isolate the section, make the repair with approved materials, and retest to confirm the system is safe.\n\nNot all gas leaks present obvious warning signs. Slow leaks at old corroded fittings or aging flexible connectors may not produce a noticeable odor until concentrations reach dangerous levels. If you have older gas piping or appliances, we recommend periodic inspection to identify problems before they become emergencies.

If a leak is found, our detection equipment locates it precisely for repair.\n\nMany home buyers now require gas pipe testing before purchase, and lenders may make it a condition of financing for older homes. Real estate agents throughout Tucson and Southern Arizona rely on Wood's Plumbing for fast, documented testing that satisfies transaction requirements.
