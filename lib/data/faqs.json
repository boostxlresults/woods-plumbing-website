    "answer": "Arizona's shifting soil, hard water, and extreme temperature changes cause pipe expansion/contraction leading to slab leaks. Copper pipes are especially vulnerable to corrosion from alkaline soil and hard water. Homes built before 1990 are at highest risk. Regular leak detection can catch problems early.",
