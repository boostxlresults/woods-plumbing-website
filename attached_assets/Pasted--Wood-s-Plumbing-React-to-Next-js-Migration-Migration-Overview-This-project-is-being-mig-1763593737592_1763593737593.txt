# Wood's Plumbing - React to Next.js Migration

## Migration Overview

This project is being migrated from **React + Express + Vite (CSR only)** to **Next.js (with SSR)** to meet the original specification requiring server-side rendering for SEO optimization.

## Original Project Specifications

- **Goal**: World-class SSR website for Wood's Plumbing Enterprises (Tucson/Marana plumbing company)
- **SEO Requirements**: Optimized for both AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) and traditional SEO
- **Scale**: MVP with 20-30 representative pages, architecture for eventual 250-500 pages
- **Content**: 66 services with individual SEO-optimized pages, 22 blog posts, comprehensive knowledge base

## Why Migration Was Needed

The original implementation used React + Vite which only supports **client-side rendering (CSR)**. The project specification explicitly required **server-side rendering (SSR)** for:
1. Improved SEO performance
2. Better initial page load times
3. AI search engine optimization
4. Social media preview generation

Attempts to add SSR to the Vite setup were blocked by protected configuration files in the Replit environment.

## Data Files Exported

All data has been exported from the original database and provided as JSON files:

1. **lib/db/schema.ts** - Complete database schema (Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL)
2. **lib/constants.ts** - Business information and configuration
3. **lib/data/services.json** - All 66 plumbing services
4. **lib/data/locations.json** - 8 service area locations
5. **lib/data/faqs.json** - 38 frequently asked questions
6. **lib/data/reviews.json** - 10 customer reviews
7. **lib/data/blog-posts.json** - 22 blog posts from original site
8. **lib/seo/schemas.ts** - Schema.org structured data generators

## Key Architecture Decisions from Original

### Database
- PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- Rate limiting on contact form (5 submissions per IP per hour)

### SEO Strategy
- Organization schema uses `@type: "Organization"` with `additionalType: "Plumber"`
- FAQPage schema generated dynamically after data loads
- Location pages use DefinedRegion schema for zip code targeting
- Dedicated `/knowledge-base` page for AI search engine optimization

### Design System
- Material Design inspired with mobile-first approach
- Trust indicators prominently displayed (46+ years, 4.9 rating, 300+ reviews, BBB A+)
- Focus on conversion optimization with clear CTAs

## Technology Stack (Original)

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Wouter for routing
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State**: TanStack Query for server state

## Next.js Implementation Notes

The Next.js version should maintain all the original features while adding SSR capabilities:

1. **App Router** recommended for modern Next.js SSR
2. **Server Components** for better performance
3. **Metadata API** for SEO optimization
4. **Image Optimization** with Next.js Image component
5. **API Routes** for contact form and data fetching
