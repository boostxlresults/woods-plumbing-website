App Router vs. Pages Router for SEO & AI SEO (AISO)

Here’s a clear breakdown comparing the App Router and Pages Router in Next.js—specifically through the lens of technical SEO, AI-readiness, and future-proofing for generative search engines.

🔧 TL;DR Recommendation

✅ Use Pages Router for now (Next.js 13/14) until App Router fully supports stable SSR for JSON-LD schema injection and metadata indexing.

🔍 Comparison Breakdown
Feature	Pages Router	App Router
Stability	Mature and battle-tested	Still maturing and changing
Schema Rendering (JSON-LD)	✅ Works well with SSR or static injection	❌ Currently stripped from HTML in many SSR attempts
SEO Metadata Control	✅ Fine-grained via getServerSideProps, Head, or next/head	⚠️ Can be unpredictable; uses new metadata.js files
AI SEO Compatibility	✅ Supports clean, crawlable HTML for vector indexing	❌ Inconsistent schema rendering leads to missing AI context
Indexability & Crawling	✅ Predictable for bots (Googlebot, AI parsers)	❌ Some SSR content may not be captured properly
Performance Optimization	✅ Great with static generation + ISR	✅ App Router is slightly faster, but not enough to outweigh SEO loss
Customization & Plugins	✅ Compatible with most third-party plugins (e.g., RealWorkLabs, Schema Builders, GTM tools)	⚠️ Limited compatibility with older ecosystem tools
Learning Curve	Low for dev teams used to traditional React	Higher—requires full buy-in to React Server Components
🧠 Why This Matters for AI SEO
Pages Router:

Ensures full schema injection at build time or during SSR

Delivers clean metadata and full HTML context, which AI scrapers and LLM parsers rely on

Can power structured sitemap generation for clear crawl paths and knowledge graph alignment

Allows deep control over canonical tags, schema modules, and dynamic meta tags

App Router (as of 2025):

Strips inline scripts for structured data (even with workarounds)

Makes it difficult to inject dynamic JSON-LD schemas per page

Still in flux—meaning future updates might break your SEO efforts without warning

🚀 Final Verdict

Until the App Router stabilizes for advanced SEO needs:

Use Pages Router for production sites focused on Google search, local 3-pack, and AI SEO discoverability.
