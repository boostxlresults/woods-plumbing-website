# How to Prevent Frozen Pipes in Tucson

While Tucson's winters are mild compared to northern cities, we do experience occasional freezing temperatures that can damage pipes. Here's how to protect your plumbing.

## Understanding the Risk

Tucson typically sees 10-15 nights below freezing each winter. When temperatures drop below 32°F, exposed pipes are at risk of freezing and bursting.

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Insulate Exposed Pipes
- Foam pipe insulation for outdoor faucets
- Heat tape for problem areas
- Focus on north-facing exterior walls
- Don't forget attic and crawl space pipes

### 2. Disconnect Garden Hoses
- Remove hoses before first freeze
- Close interior shut-off valves
- Open outdoor faucets to drain
- Install freeze-proof hose bibbs

### 3. Let Faucets Drip
During freezing nights:
- Let both hot and cold water drip slightly
- Focus on faucets along exterior walls
- Moving water resists freezing

### 4. Open Cabinet Doors
- Allow warm air to reach pipes under sinks
- Especially important for exterior walls
- Keep thermostat consistent overnight

## What If Pipes Freeze?

1. **Shut off main water** - Prevent flooding if pipes burst
2. **Open faucets** - Relieve pressure buildup
3. **Apply gentle heat** - Never use open flames
4. **Call professionals** - Don't risk bursting frozen pipes

## Tucson-Specific Considerations

Our desert climate creates unique challenges:
- Pipes aren't buried as deep as northern climates
- Homes built before 1980 often lack proper insulation
- Outdoor plumbing is more common (evaporative coolers, etc.)
- Rapid temperature swings stress pipes

## Long-Term Solutions

Consider these permanent fixes:
- **Reroute exposed pipes** - Move them to protected areas
- **Add insulation** - Improve overall home insulation
- **Upgrade fixtures** - Install freeze-proof hose bibbs
- **Smart shut-offs** - Automatic shut-off systems for emergencies

## The Cost of Prevention vs. Repair

Prevention costs: $50-200 for insulation and freeze-proof fixtures
Burst pipe repair: $500-5,000+ including water damage

Wood's Plumbing has served Tucson since 1979. We've seen countless freeze-damaged pipes and can help you prevent this expensive problem.
